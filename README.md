Duelbot is a discord bot that allows users to earn points through reactions, and automated drops created by the bot. 

With points, users can duel other users in a luck-based battle system, utilizing various weapons, events, and values.

Each weapon and event have different and unique values, such as damage points, break chance, critical rate, and more.

Users can use their points to prestige as well, earning them prestige levels which will raise their spot on the prestige leaderboard.

The leaderboard displays 10 users per page, ordered by points or prestige
